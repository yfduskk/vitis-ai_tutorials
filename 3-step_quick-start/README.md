# 3-Step Quick Start to Vitis AI on Edge Devices

This tutorial is intended to help users get started quickly with the deployment of [Vitis AI](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vitis/vitis-ai.html) using edge devices.  In particular, a 3-step process will be used to deploy Vitis AI examples on either a [ZCU102](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/ek-u1-zcu102-g.html) or [ZCU104](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/zcu104.html) Xilinx evaluation board.  Because this tutorial is focusing on deployment, the development and compilation of neural networks (from a standard framework such as Caffe or TensorFlow) with Vitis AI is not covered.  Instead the Vitis AI Model Zoo is leveraged to test pre-compiled networks.  The 3 steps of this tutorial are summarized below:

 1. [Setup Vitis AI and run example applications with minimal dependencies](step1.md)
 2. [Add Vitis AI Library and Model Zoo and run dependent sample applications](step2.md)
 3. [Build and run more comprehensive demonstration code](step3.md)

*NOTE: This tutorial was written against the Vitis 2019.2 and Vitis AI 1.0 releases*
