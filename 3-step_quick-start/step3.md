[STEP 1](step1.md) | [STEP 2](step2.md) | **STEP 3**

# Step 3

1. Setup Vitis AI and run example applications with minimal dependencies
2. Add Vitis AI Library and Model Zoo and run dependent sample applications
3. **Build and run more comprehensive demonstration code**

This final step of the tutorial will cover running the example applications under the `demo` directory that's provided by the Vitis AI install package.

These examples are a good reference point for source code because they don't rely on any pre-compiled libs.  That is, all the code is entirely re-useable for your own application.
